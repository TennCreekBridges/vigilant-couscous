## INTRODUCTION
Beginning of personal portfolio showcasing previous work, including name, a recent photo, links to a section about me, my work, and how to contact me. Links are fully functional in navigation menus.

After clicking on the Work section from the nav bar, the first application is larger than the rest of the projects that are showcased, and all are titled. Project images and titles are all links, though placeholder project names and images have been used (linked out to '#') with exception of the 'Run Buddy' project.

The design is responsively coded using rem as the unit of measurement of font size, and many of the images and divs are scaled using % of browser width.

While I am not 100% pleased with some of the aesthetics (the main nav menu at the smaller sizes - could NOT get the any kind of margin added to the menu and also the Contact Us section at the bottom which I couldn't manage to accomodate my flow in the same way 'Why HELLO' and 'Work' did, I was ultimately pleased with the enormous amount of knowledge I've come away from with this project.
